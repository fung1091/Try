## Learning Objectives

* Identify the type of variables (e.g. numerical or categorical; discrite or continuous; ordered or not ordered).
* Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. indepedent vs. dependent).
* Define variables that are not associated as independent.
* Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies.
* Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks
of choosing one sampling scheme over another.
* Identify the four principles of experimental design and recognize their purposes: control any possible con- founders, randomize into treatment and control groups, replicate by using a sufficiently large sample or repeat- ing the experiment, and block any variables that might influence the response.
* Use appropriate visualizations for different types of data (e.g. histogram, barplot, scatterplot, boxplot, etc.).
* Use different measures of center and spread and be able to describe the robustness of different statistics.
* Describe the shape of distributions vis-à-vis histograms and boxplots.
* Create and intepret contingency and frequency tables (one- and two-way tables).


## Assignments

### Homework

*OpenIntro Statistics*

* Practice: 1.7 (available in R using the `data(iris)` command), 1.9, 1.23, 1.33, 1.55, 1.69
* Graded: 1.8, 1.10, 1.28, 1.36, 1.48, 1.50, 1.56, 1.70

For 1.48, the following R code will create a vector `scores` that can be used to answer the question:
```{r}
scores <- c(57, 66, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, 78, 79, 79, 81, 81, 82, 83, 83, 88, 89, 94)
```

### Lab 1

The labs are available in the `IS606` R package. To start the first lab, use the `startLab` function. This will copy the lab to your current working directory and rename the file according to your computer username (as returend by `Sys.info()['user']`). If this is incorrect, then either provide the `file-prefix` parameter to `startLab`, or rename the file after it has been copied.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
viewLab('Lab1')
startLab('Lab1')
```

## Readings

* [OpenIntro Statistics slides](https://github.com/jbryer/IS606Fall2015/raw/master/Slides/OpenIntro/os2_slides_01.pdf)
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) - `ggplot2` is an R package by Wickham that implements the [grammer of graphics](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) (Wilkinson, 2005) in R. I will frequently make use of the graphing framework throughout the course and is worth learning.
* [Visualizing Likert Data](http://jason.bryer.org/likert/) - An R package for visualizing [Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) data built on the `ggplot2` framework.
* [Quick-R base graphics](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/index.html) - Covers many of the visualizations using R's base graphics.

## Note about Pie Charts

There is only one pie chart in *OpenIntro Statistics* (Diez, Barr, & Çetinkaya-Rundel, 2015, p. 48). Consider the following three pie charts that represent the preference of five different colors. Is there a difference between the three pie charts? This is probably a difficult to answer.

![Pie](Pie.png)

However, consider the bar plot below. Here, we cleary see there is a difference between the ratio of the three colors. As John Tukey famously said:

> There is no data that can be displayed in a pie chart that cannot better be displayed in some other type of chart
