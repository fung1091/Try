### Lab 1

The labs are available in the `IS606` R package. To start the first lab, use the `startLab` function. This will copy the lab to your current working directory and rename the file according to your computer username (as returend by `Sys.info()['user']`). If this is incorrect, then either provide the `file-prefix` parameter to `startLab`, or rename the file after it has been copied.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
IS606::startLab('Lab8')
```
